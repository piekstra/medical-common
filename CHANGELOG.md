# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-11-12

First release. Pins cli-common v0.29.0.

- `pk-med-records`: the `health-records/v1` profile (DESIGN.md §1).
  `Organization` (`org-list/v1`), `PatientContext` (`patient-list/v1`),
  `Provenance` (`provenance/v1`) with `Provenance::from_stream`,
  `RecordsExport` (`records-export/v1`) and `create_export_file` (mode
  0600, no symbolic links). The `records-stream/v1` stream: `Header`
  (with optional `method`), `Trailer` with counts, skips and
  `complete`, `Skip` and its codes, `RecordsWriter` (dedupe by type and
  id, 64 MiB line limit, `complete: false` on a failure after the header)
  and `RecordsReader` (bounded lines; refuses a missing header or
  trailer, a count mismatch, a line after the trailer, an incomplete
  stream). Feature `test-util`: `write_synthetic_stream`.
- `pk-med-fhir`: our own FHIR R4 / US Core types for 19 resource types
  and their datatypes, each keeping unknown elements in `extra`;
  ExplanationOfBenefit and Coverage in the CARIN Blue Button shape;
  `RawResource` and `RawBundle` keep the server's own text, so decimals
  keep their spelling; `Resource::find_contained`; `Binary::bytes`;
  `Money::to_money`; `normalize_base`. `FhirClient` over
  `pk_cli_core::transport::Transport`: read, search with `next` paging
  under a page cap, Binary as FHIR JSON, `get_raw`; requests only to the
  base's origin; retries under `RetryPolicy` with `Retry-After`; HTTP
  status and OperationOutcome mapped to exit codes 3, 4 and 5. Feature
  `test-util`: a loopback mock SMART + FHIR server and a synthetic
  patient with every resource type.
